# Topology-Drawer
A tool for generating the topology of a Docker cluster

This program consists of two parts:

  - netfilter module that gathers the connectivity information of several nodes. This data is sent to a remote node acting as the observer.
  
  - java program that uses the data from the previous step to generate the topology.
